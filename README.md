# Atari-Breakout-Bot
A bot that can automatically play Atari Breakout.
This bot uses pyautogui's moveTo function to make a bot that can play Atari Breakout.

# required-libraries
Before you can run the script, you need the libraries:

*Time*, for the starting time.sleep

*PyAutoGui*, for the main parts of the script

*OpenCV*, for the confidence guage in the locating part of the script

# how-to-run

I personally suggest running the script in Python Shell,
so in case if you want to end the script early,

just do CTRL + ALT + DELETE. This will activate a fail-safe, which will end the script.
